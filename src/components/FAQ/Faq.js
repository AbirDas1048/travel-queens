                        React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about our application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.
                        A React application is made of multiple components, each responsible for rendering a small, reusable piece of HTML. Components can be nested within other components to allow complex applications to be built out of simple building blocks.

                        <strong>State</strong>
                        <p>The state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data or information about the component and can change over time. The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system event. It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render. A state must be kept as simple as possible. It represents the component's local state or information. It can only be accessed or modified inside the component or by the component directly.</p>

                        <strong>Props</strong>
                        <p>Props are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It allows passing data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments and can be passed to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function. Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component.</p>

                        The useEffect Hook allows us to perform side effects in our components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers. Itâ€™s the solution to many problems: how to fetch data when a component mounts, how to run code when state changes or when a prop changes, how to set up timers or intervals.
